# Commitment & Advancement — Mom Test Reference

## Purpose

Use this file when evaluating whether a customer conversation produced real signal or was a waste of time. Apply these criteria to assess meeting outcomes, identify zombie leads, spot earlyvangelists, and determine the right commitment to request at each stage.

---

## 1. Commitment vs Advancement

**Commitment**: The customer gives up something of value — time, reputation, or money — demonstrating they are serious.

**Advancement**: The conversation moves to the next step of the real-world sales funnel.

These two concepts overlap and tend to appear together. Treat them as functionally equivalent when evaluating meeting outcomes. A meeting that produces neither is a failed meeting, regardless of how warm or enthusiastic the conversation felt.

Compliments cost nothing. They are worth nothing. They produce no data. Strip all compliments out of your assessment of whether a meeting succeeded.

## 2. Three Commitment Currencies

### Time

- Clear next meeting with known, specific goals (not "let's stay in touch")
- Sitting down to give feedback on wireframes or a prototype
- Using a trial for a non-trivial, defined period

### Reputation

- Intro to peers or members of their team
- Intro to a decision maker — their boss, spouse, lawyer, procurement officer
- Agreeing to give a public testimonial or participate in a case study

### Financial

- Letter of intent (non-legal but a gentlemanly agreement with real weight)
- Pre-order against a future product
- Deposit on delivery

**Strong commitments combine currencies.** A paid trial with rollout to the whole team combines time, money, and reputation simultaneously — the customer has now put skin in the game on multiple dimensions.

When evaluating commitment strength, ask: how many currencies does this involve? What did they actually give up?

## 3. Meeting Success / Failure — Binary Only

There is no such thing as a meeting that "went well." There are only two outcomes:

**Success**: The meeting ends with a commitment that advances to the next step in the real-world funnel.

**Failure**: The meeting ends with a compliment or a stalling tactic.

### Two failure modes that cause bad meetings

1. **Asking for opinions** — invites compliments instead of commitments
2. **Not asking for commitment or next steps at all** — the most common and most costly mistake

Not asking for commitment is worse than being rejected. Rejection provides data: the lead is not qualified, the offer is wrong, the timing is off. Not asking gives you zero information while consuming your time and the customer's goodwill.

Make asking for next steps a habit at every meeting close. Have the next step already prepared before the meeting ends.

## 4. Meeting Response Classification

Classify each response from a customer conversation:

| Response | Verdict | Why | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|-----|
| "That's so cool. I love it!" | BAD | Pure compliment. Zero data. | Deflect the compliment. Return to business questions. |
| "Looks great. Let me know when it launches." | BAD | Compliment plus stalling tactic. Not a pre-order. Not a commitment. | Ask for commitment today: intro to their boss, signup for alpha test, letter of intent. |
| "There are people I can intro you to when you're ready." | NEARLY BAD | Generic promise. "People" is vague. "When you're ready" is indefinite. | Convert the fuzzy to concrete: who specifically, when, and why not right now? |
| "What are the next steps?" | GOOD | Classic success signal. They are advancing. They want to continue the relationship. | Have next steps prepared. Do not say "Let me think about it." Give a concrete answer immediately. |
| "I would definitely buy that." | BAD | The most dangerous false positive in customer development. This exact phrase cost one startup $10M in wasted runway. | Shift to concrete: "Great — would you be willing to sign a letter of intent? Put down a deposit? Back a Kickstarter?" Watch what they do, not what they say. |
| "When can we start the trial?" | MAYBE GOOD | "Start" is stronger than "launch" — they are initiating rather than waiting. But check the cost of the trial. | If the trial is free or cheap, raise the stakes: ask for a case study, require team rollout, take a credit card. |
| "Can I buy the prototype?" | GREAT | The best possible meeting conclusion. Cash commitment with no ambiguity. | Take the money. |
| "When can you come back to talk to the rest of the team?" | GOOD | Multi-stakeholder advancement. Enterprise signal. If they refuse to intro you to the rest of the team, you have hit a dead end with this contact. | Schedule it immediately. Ask who will be in the room and what their roles are. |

## 5. Zombie Leads

**Definition**: Potential customers who keep taking meetings, say nice things, never cut a check, and never reject you either.

The startup has been friend-zoned. The customer gets value from the relationship (feeling helpful, staying informed, low-effort validation of their own views) without paying. The startup gets a false sense of progress.

### Causes

- Founder is clingy and avoids rejection
- Founder never gives the customer a clear chance to commit or refuse
- Meetings end with "we'll keep talking" rather than a specific next step with cost

### Symptoms

- A pipeline full of "interested" leads
- Meetings that consistently end with compliments and no concrete next steps
- The customer has never given up anything of value — no time block, no intro, no money
- You have had three or more meetings with this person and they have not committed to anything

### Fix

Give them a clear, concrete opportunity to commit or reject. Stop protecting them from the decision. Frame it directly:

"We're moving to the next phase and I want to know if you're in. Would you be willing to [specific commitment]?"

If they stall or deflect again, they are not a real lead. Remove them from active pipeline. A clear rejection is more valuable than a zombie relationship.

## 6. Earlyvangelists — Steve Blank's Four Criteria

First customers are not rational adopters. They buy before the product is mature, before social proof exists, before the risk calculus favors them. All four criteria must be true:

1. They have the problem
2. They know they have the problem
3. They have the budget to solve the problem
4. They have already cobbled together their own makeshift solution

The fourth criterion is the most important and the most overlooked. If they have not yet attempted to solve the problem themselves — built a spreadsheet, hired a freelancer, duct-taped two tools together — they do not feel the pain acutely enough to be a first customer.

### Identifying earlyvangelists in conversation

**Strong signal**: Deep emotion. Not "Yeah, that's a problem" — actual frustration, genuine excitement, stories of failed workarounds. They are reading your blog before the product exists. They are searching for solutions and finding nothing. They are willing to put money on a prototype.

**Weak signal**: Intellectual agreement with the problem. They nod, they understand why the problem matters, they have no personal urgency.

**When you see deep emotion**: Keep that person close. They will get you through the hard early period when the product is not ready and most customers say no.

**When someone is not emotional**: They are unlikely to be a first customer. Keep them on the list for later, but do not count on them to validate your business model.

## 7. Product Risk vs Market Risk

Conversations validate market risk. They have limited value for product risk.

**Market risk questions** (conversations help):
- Do they want this?
- Will they pay for it?
- Are there enough of them?

**Product risk questions** (conversations have limited value):
- Can you build it?
- Can you grow it to critical mass?
- Will they keep using it over time?

### The key test

If the customer says "If you can build what you say, I'll pay" — the risk is in the product, not the market. Conversations cannot resolve product risk. You have to build.

### Examples by risk type

| Scenario | Risk Type | Implication |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Farm fertility monitor: "If you can build it, I'll equip my whole herd" | Product | Stop talking. Start building. |
| Bar/club foot traffic app: both sides of the marketplace say yes | Product | Can you build critical mass on both sides simultaneously? Conversations cannot answer this. |
| Video games | Product | "Do you like fun?" is not a useful research question. |
| Affiliate commissions: established model, risk is in your traffic | Product | The model is proven. Your execution is the variable. |
| B2B SaaS where buyers confirm the pain and budget | Market | Validate through conversations, then close commitments before building. |

**When product risk dominates**: Start building earlier. Use conversations to get your starting point, not to fully validate. Do not over-index on customer interviews when what you need is a working product.

## 8. Don't Pitch Blind — Even in Sales Meetings

Even when the purpose of the meeting is to pitch or sell, begin with open-ended learning. Understand what is specific and unique about this particular customer before you pitch.

Hard pitching without learning produces binary feedback: you either nailed it or you didn't. You learn almost nothing about why.

Better approach:
1. Ask Mom Test questions first — understand their current situation, their workarounds, their workflow
2. Identify what matters most to this person specifically
3. Confirm by selling — tailor the pitch to what you learned in the first ten minutes

"You always need learning questions, even in a sales meeting."

The learning phase is not wasted time. It is the context that makes the pitch land harder.

---

## 9. Commitment Escalation by Stage

Match the commitment you ask for to the current stage of development. Asking for a purchase before the product exists kills trust. Asking only for "feedback" when the product is live leaves money on the table.

| Stage | Appropriate Commitment to Request |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| Early exploration | Intro to relevant peers, agreement to follow up with a specific goal |
| Problem validated | Feedback session on wireframes, intro to the decision maker |
| Solution designed | Trial with real usage defined upfront, letter of intent |
| Product exists | Paid trial, pre-order, deposit |
| Scaling | Purchase, case study, public testimonial |

**Principle**: "In early-stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is a side effect."

**Principle**: "It is not a real lead until you have given them a concrete chance to reject you."

Push commitments to be specific. Vague commitments ("I'll introduce you to some people") have an expiration date and rarely materialize. Concrete commitments ("I'll intro you to Sarah, our procurement lead, on Thursday") are trackable and reveal whether the customer is serious.

## Quick Diagnostic: Was This Meeting a Success?

Run through this check after any customer conversation:

1. Did the meeting end with a concrete next step? (Yes / No)
2. Did the customer give up something of value — time, reputation, or money? (Yes / No)
3. Did the customer make any specific commitment, not a general expression of interest? (Yes / No)

If all three are Yes: the meeting was a success. Document what was committed and when.

If any are No: the meeting produced compliments, not data. Identify which failure mode occurred (you asked for opinions, you didn't ask for commitment at all, or you accepted a vague stalling response as sufficient). Fix it in the next meeting.
