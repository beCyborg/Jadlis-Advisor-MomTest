## 1. The Meeting Anti-Pattern

The default instinct when someone says "I need to talk to customers" is to schedule formal meetings. Resist this.

**Why formal meetings hurt you:**
- 1 hour meeting = ~4 hours total when you factor in commute, the back-and-forth to find a time, and post-meeting review
- Creates wrong expectations: they assume you'll show them a product or pitch them something
- You miss serendipitous learning opportunities that happen in conversation, not in calendar blocks
- Early-stage conversations only need 5-10 minutes to accomplish their goal

**Symptoms of over-formality:**
- Opening with "Thanks for agreeing to this interview..."
- Asking "On a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate..."
- Sending a calendar invite before you've even spoken once
- Preparing a slide deck for an exploratory call

**The fix:** Keep it casual. Strip the formality. Chat at events, conferences, cafes, hallways. A conversation that doesn't feel like a meeting produces better data than one that does.

**Rule to remember:** If it feels like they're doing you a favour by talking to you, it's probably too formal.

## 2. Keeping It Casual

The first conversation does not need to be a meeting. Learning about a customer works better as a quick casual chat than a long formal meeting.

**Time calibration:**
- 5 minutes is enough to learn whether a problem exists and whether it matters
- 10-15 minutes gives you a clear picture of someone's workflow and pain points
- At an industry meetup, you can have a dozen conversations in a single evening

**Giving as little as possible:** While nudging the conversation toward useful territory, give as little information about your idea as possible. You want their unfiltered experience, not their reaction to your solution.

**Two examples of casual learning in action:**

Example 1 — Investor dealflow idea: Someone was about to take a formal meeting to explore a startup idea around investor dealflow. Before the meeting even started, a few minutes of smalltalk with the investor revealed that no such problem existed in the form imagined. The idea was disproved in 5 minutes, saving weeks of work and the awkwardness of a formal pitch.

Example 2 — Office managers at a Monday event: Chatting with office managers at an industry event, the real problem that surfaced wasn't efficiency (the assumed pain) — it was debt collection. Nobody in the conversation realized "they'd had a meeting." The learning was real; the formality was zero.

## 3. Going to Them — Channels

When you have to initiate, use these channels in roughly this order of friction:

**Cold calls and cold messages**

The goal of cold outreach is to stop needing it. Hustle hard for the first 1-2 conversations, then use those to get warm introductions that snowball. Expect 98 out of 100 to ignore you — that's fine. You now have 2 conversations. The rejection rate is irrelevant unless cold calls are your actual sales channel. Don't optimize for the rejections; optimize for what you do with the 2 who respond.

**Seizing serendipity**

At parties, conferences, and cafes: when you hear someone mention your topic area, start a conversation. Do it naturally. They leave thinking you're interested in their career and life; you leave with customer insight and possibly a warm introduction or a soft commitment. These conversations are often the most honest because no one is performing for an "interview."

**Find a good excuse**

"This coffee is amazing — can I ask you about the beans?" works because it's organic. PhD students have the ultimate excuse: research. If you're studying a topic, almost anyone will talk to you for 10 minutes. Find the equivalent excuse for your industry. If it's a topic both of you care about, an excuse is easy to construct.

**Immerse yourself**

Go where your customers are. Conference circuit, industry events, online communities, Slack groups, subreddits. You'll meet people naturally. Even if you later decide this segment is wrong for you, the immersion gives you real knowledge about how the industry thinks, what language they use, and what they actually worry about.

**Landing pages**

Not useful for quantitative validation — conversion metrics at early stage are unreliable and easy to misread. What they are useful for: collecting email addresses of qualified leads who are self-selected to care about the problem. Email those people and have conversations. Joel Gascoigne (Buffer) validated his idea this way. The value wasn't the conversion rate. The value was the conversations he had with the people who signed up.

## 4. Bringing Them to You

Much better than going to them. When people come to you, they take you seriously and want to help. The dynamic flips entirely.

**Organize meetups**

"HR professionals happy hour" — instantly you're the credible organizer. You meet everyone in the room. You can have a dozen conversations without a single cold approach. This is the single best unfair trick for rapid customer learning, and almost nobody does it.

It also bootstraps industry credibility from day one. You don't need to be an expert to organize an event for experts. You just need to organize it.

This is the first thing to try in a new industry if there's any organizing muscle available.

**Speaking and teaching**

Teach about the problem space, not your solution. This accomplishes three things simultaneously: refines your message under pressure, puts you in front of a room of potential customers who treat you as credible, and lets you observe which parts of the problem resonate most. After speaking, chat up the keenest attendees. They self-identified.

**Industry blogging**

A relevant blog brings conversations to you. Even without an audience, a blog makes cold emails dramatically more credible. Prospects check your domain, see genuine industry content, and agree to meet because you're clearly not a random outsider. It also forces you to organize your own thinking about the problem space, which sharpens your questions.

**Get creative about convening**

One example: a founder targeting university department heads organized semi-monthly "knowledge exchange" calls between heads of departments at three top universities. Other universities could dial in. This positioned the founder as a neutral convener, absorbed the credibility of the top schools, and gave direct access to exactly the decision makers they needed to learn from — without a single cold call.

The pattern: find a format where your target customers have a reason to show up, and you're the one who created the reason.

## 5. Creating Warm Introductions

Cold outreach is expensive. Warm introductions are free once the network exists. Build the network aggressively early.

**Everyone knows someone. Just ask.**

Standing on a chair in a coworking space: "Does anyone know someone at McKinsey?" — bought 3 people beers, left with a diary full of introductions. The ask is awkward for 10 seconds. The results last for weeks.

**Industry advisors**

Recruit 5 advisors with roughly 0.5% equity each. Meet each one once a month. Each meeting produces a fresh batch of introductions. Advisors are recruited from early customer conversations — the people who were most excited and most helpful are natural candidates. This creates a self-sustaining introduction engine.

**Universities**

Professors are a goldmine. They're funded by, and know, senior industry people who are self-selected to be excited about new projects. They're easy to reach (posted emails, open office hours, conference presence). A professor in the relevant field can introduce you to exactly the kind of experienced practitioner who is hard to cold-approach.

**Investors**

Top-tier VCs have exceptional rolodexes and the social permission to cold-introduce anyone to anyone. They can connect you into B2B segments that would otherwise take months to access. They can also help land higher-tier advisors. Even if you're not raising, investor conversations are worth pursuing early for the introduction network alone.

**Cash in old favors**

All those people who said "Keep me in the loop — let me know how I can help." Reply to that ancient email thread and ask for a specific introduction. You'll be ignored a lot. That's fine. Don't make a habit of it (burning goodwill repeatedly closes doors), but when you're stuck, the "how can I help" inventory is worth working through.

## 6. The VFWPA Formula for Formal Meeting Requests

When a formal meeting genuinely can't be avoided, structure the request to get a yes and set the right expectations. Five elements, in this order:

1. **Vision** — Half a sentence on how you're making the world better. Do not mention your idea or product.
2. **Framing** — What stage you're at and what you're looking for. If you have nothing to sell yet, say so explicitly.
3. **Weakness** — A specific gap you need help with. This signals you're not wasting their time and that you're actually looking to learn.
4. **Pedestal** — Why them specifically. Not generic flattery. What particular experience or knowledge makes them the right person.
5. **Ask** — The request. Soft, specific, easy to say yes to.

Mnemonic: "Very Few Wizards Properly Ask [for help]"

**Example 1 (desk rental, tenant-to-landlord):**

> "Hey Pete, I'm trying to make desk rental less of a pain for new businesses [V]. We're just starting out and don't have anything to sell [F]. I've only ever come at it from the tenant side and am having trouble understanding the landlord perspective [W]. You've been renting out desks for a while and could really help cut through the fog [P]. Do you have time in the next couple weeks to meet up? [A]"

**Example 2 (advertising, higher stakes):**

> "Hey Scott, I run a startup trying to make advertising more playful and effective [V]. We're having trouble figuring out how the industry pieces fit together [W]. You know more about this than anyone and could save us from tons of mistakes [P]. We're funded with products out, but this isn't a sales meeting — just moving into a new area [F]. Can you spare time this week over a coffee? [A]"

Note on example 2: Framing comes after Weakness and Pedestal. The order isn't rigid — what matters is that all five elements are present. Read the specific situation and adjust.

## 7. The Advisory Flip

This is a mindset switch, not a tactic. Instead of going out looking for customers to interview, go out looking for advisors.

**Why it changes everything:**
- Shifts the vibe from needy to evaluative
- You're in control because you're assessing whether they're the right kind of helpful, knowledgeable person
- They pick up on this dynamic without you saying anything explicitly
- The same topics get discussed, but both you and they notice the difference

**How to apply it:**
- Do not announce "I'm looking for advisors" unless the conversation naturally arrives there
- The flip is internal: remind yourself that you are finding people who are excited about your space and can actually help
- Evaluate them honestly. Not everyone who agrees to talk is someone worth recruiting

**The underlying principle:** Willpower is finite. Change the circumstances so they require less willpower. When you believe you're the evaluator, you don't need to force yourself to stop being needy — the neediness isn't there.

## 8. Meeting Duration Guide

| Conversation Type | Duration | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Does this problem exist? | 5 min | Quick pulse check, serendipitous encounter |
| Workflow understanding | 10-15 min | You need to understand their process and pain |
| Industry deep-dive | 60+ min | Expert is willing to monologue — point them in the right direction and listen |
| Formal B2B (scheduled) | 30 min | 5 min hello, 5 min questions, 10 min product demo, 5 min next steps |
| Casual at event | 5-10 min | Most valuable per-minute format available |

Don't over-schedule. A 5-minute hallway conversation that answers your key question is worth more than a 90-minute formal interview that produces polite noise.

## 9. In-Person vs Remote

Default to in-person. Every exception is a deliberate trade-off, not a convenience.

**Why in-person matters:**
- Losing face and body language means losing critical data about emotional response
- Phone and video calls create a formal dynamic that kills casual conversation
- People on calls want to "finish the business" and hang up — they don't linger, they don't go on tangents, and the tangents are often where the real insight lives
- Nobody becomes friends over the phone, which means warm introductions don't flow out of remote conversations the way they do from in-person ones

**When remote is acceptable:**
- Geographic impossibility
- A conversation that's already warm and just needs a follow-up
- After the relationship is established in-person

Start in-person. Move to remote only when the alternative is no conversation at all.

## 10. How Many Conversations Are Enough

- **3-5** if the segment is focused and the industry is simple
- **More than 10 and still getting mixed signals** — the segment is too broad; tighten it before continuing
- **Keep talking until you stop hearing new information** — this is the UX research community's rule and it holds here too
- The goal is to learn what you need as fast as possible, then get back to building

The failure mode is running too many conversations as a substitute for making decisions. Conversations are input. At some point, you have enough input. Make the call.

**Rule:** Keep having conversations until you stop hearing new stuff. Then stop and act on what you learned.
