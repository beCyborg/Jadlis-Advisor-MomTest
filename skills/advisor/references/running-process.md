# Running the Process: Preparation, Execution, and Review

Reference for the full conversation lifecycle: before, during, and after customer conversations.

## The Learning Bottleneck Anti-Pattern

The most common failure mode in customer learning is concentrating all conversations in one person — usually the CEO or the most customer-facing founder.

**How it breaks down:**

One person goes to all meetings, then tells the team "what I learned." In practice, this means "what you'll do." The learning gets filtered through their interpretation, their agenda, and their current beliefs. What reaches the team is already partially cooked.

This creates a de-facto dictator who can end any product debate with "The customer said so." It's the ultimate trump card. No one can challenge it because no one else was in the room.

The data might be true. The problem is that it was never communicated to the team in a way they could evaluate, question, or absorb. Fitzpatrick's own CTO quit, saying "We'll never succeed if you keep changing what we're doing." The insights were probably legitimate — but the team never had a chance to understand them or believe them.

**Symptoms of the bottleneck:**
- "You just worry about the product. I'll learn what we need to know."
- "Because the customers told me so!"
- "I don't have time to talk to people — I need to be coding!"

**The fix:** The whole founding team prepares together. Key members attend meetings. Notes are reviewed together. Learning is disseminated through direct quotes and shared data, not interpretations. Customer learning is not a solo sport.

## Before a Batch of Conversations

**Full prep checklist:**
- [ ] Choose a focused, findable segment (if not yet done)
- [ ] With your team, decide your 3 big learning goals for this batch
- [ ] If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments to push for
- [ ] Figure out who to talk to
- [ ] Create best guesses about what this person cares about
- [ ] If a question could be answered via desk research, do that first
- [ ] Basic due diligence: LinkedIn, company website (5 minutes max)

**Key prep questions to unearth hidden risks:**

Run these thought experiments before every batch:

1. "If this company were to fail, why would it have happened?" — surfaces assumptions you've been avoiding
2. "What would have to be true for this to be a huge success?" — from Lafley and Martin; forces you to name the dependencies

These questions define which risks are worth investigating. Ask them with the full team, not alone.

**Minimum viable prep (if tight on time):**

"What do we want to learn from these guys?"

That's enough to avoid the worst failures. Don't skip even this minimum.

**Who should be in the prep session:**

Sit down with the whole founding team. Both business and product sides must be represented. If only one side preps, you'll only hear the questions that side cares about. Missing part of the team means missing their concerns entirely — and you'll waste the conversation.

**Time budget:**

Spend up to one hour. No more. Anything beyond that is stalling. You're trying to get to a conversation, not to perfect the conversation before it happens.

## During the Conversation

**Conversation checklist:**
- [ ] Frame the conversation (use VFWPA structure if formal, or just a casual opening if informal)
- [ ] Keep it casual — strip formality wherever possible
- [ ] Ask questions that pass The Mom Test (past behavior, not future hypotheticals)
- [ ] Deflect compliments, anchor vague statements, dig beneath weak signals
- [ ] Take notes using signal symbols
- [ ] If appropriate, press for commitment and next steps
- [ ] End with "Who else should I talk to?" and "Is there anything I should have asked?"

The goal of every conversation is to move from uncertainty to useful data. Keep that as your north star when deciding what to pursue in the moment.

## After a Batch of Conversations

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] With your team, review notes and key customer quotes
- [ ] Transfer notes to permanent storage if not already done
- [ ] Update your beliefs and plans based on new data
- [ ] Decide on the next 3 big questions to investigate
- [ ] Discuss meta-level: which questions worked, which didn't, what to improve next time

Review is simple but not optional. The pattern to avoid: go to meetings, feel good about them, never look at notes again, keep building what you were already building.

Disseminate learning quickly and directly. Use exact quotes, not paraphrased interpretations. Interpretations are how bias re-enters the system. A quote is a quote — the team can evaluate it themselves.

## The 12 Note-Taking Symbols

Use a consistent symbol system so notes from different team members can be merged and sorted.

| Symbol | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| :) | Excited | Strong positive emotion from the subject |
| :( | Angry | Strong negative emotion — frustration, rage |
| :\| | Embarrassed | Uncomfortable topic — likely highly important |
| ☇ | Pain or problem | Their core pain point (lightning bolt) |
| ⨅ | Goal or job-to-be-done | What they are trying to achieve |
| ☐ | Obstacle | What prevents them from solving the problem themselves |
| ⤴ | Workaround | What they currently do to cope (very high signal) |
| ^ | Background / context | Distant mountain — setting the scene |
| ☑ | Feature request or purchasing criteria | Note it, do not blindly obey it |
| ＄ | Money / budgets / purchasing | Pricing signals, budget constraints, who approves spend |
| ♀ | Specific person or company mentioned | If a person: ask for intro. If a company: research as competitor or reference |
| ☆ | Follow-up task | Items to act on after the meeting ends |

**Combining symbols:**

Symbols compound. ☇ + :( = a painful problem they're angry about. This is your highest priority signal. ⤴ + ＄ = a workaround they're paying for — strong indicator of real willingness to pay.

**Capturing emotional context:**

"That's a problem" means completely different things depending on whether they say it neutrally, with a sigh, or with visible irritation. Always note the emotion alongside the content. Emotion is data. Neutral = lower priority. Outrage = investigate immediately.

## Note-Taking Medium

Notes are only useful if you can retrieve and act on them. The medium must support that.

**Requirements:**
- Sortable, mixable, rearrangeable
- Combinable with your team's notes
- Permanent and retrievable later
- Separate from random todos and half-formed ideas

**Good options:**

**Index cards or Post-its** (Fitzpatrick's preference): Write one quote or learning per card, with a signal symbol. After the meeting, add the date and person's name to each card. Lay them out on a table for team review. Sort by signal type to find patterns. Physical, tactile, easy to cluster.

**Google Sheets / spreadsheets**: Excellent for sharing, searching, and retrieval. Put key signals in their own columns so you can sort and filter. Main downside: typing during a meeting looks rude and can kill rapport. Plan to transfer notes shortly after the conversation.

**Dedicated notebook**: Fine if you carry it consistently. Tear out pages that aren't interview notes so retrieval is manageable.

**What to avoid:**

A regular notebook used for everything — meetings, todos, ideas, grocery lists — becomes unsearchable. Audio recordings sound thorough but can't be sorted, searched, or skimmed. They create the illusion of capturing learning without enabling the use of it.

**For conversations caught by surprise:**

Write on anything — a napkin, a beer mat, a newspaper margin. The medium doesn't matter. Transfer to your main system when you're back at the office. Capturing on something weird beats trying to reconstruct from memory an hour later.

**If taking notes is inappropriate in the moment:**

Have the conversation. Then immediately excuse yourself and retreat to a corner, a bathroom, or a nearby bench to write down what was said. Do it within ten minutes. Memory degrades fast.

The rule: "Notes are useless if you don't look at them." A perfect note-taking system you never consult is worse than a napkin you act on.

## Who Should Attend Meetings

**Ideal setup:** Two people. One leads the conversation, one takes notes. The second person catches bad questions in real time and notices signals the first person missed while talking.

**Don't send more than two** (unless it's a group-on-group meeting by design). Three people interviewing one customer is overwhelming and changes the power dynamic.

**Solo is viable** once you're experienced at taking concise notes and catching yourself. The main risk solo: harder to notice when you've gone off track. Have a trusted teammate review your notes afterward.

**Shy founders with no cofounder:** Bring a friend to the first few conversations. Play the note-taker role while they handle the talking. Switch gradually as comfort builds.

**Never outsource the learning itself:**

You can hire someone to set up meetings. You cannot hire someone to attend them in your place. Hired guns gloss over lukewarm signals because they're optimizing for a good report, not accurate data. They make it easy to assimilate only the good news. Founders must be in the room.

Everyone making big decisions — including technical decisions — should attend some customer conversations. A CTO who has never spoken to a customer will build the wrong abstractions. A CEO who attends all the meetings and filters the learning is creating a single point of failure.

## Signs You're Just Going Through the Motions

Conversations without learning are worse than no conversations. They consume time and create false confidence. Run this checklist to detect when you're performing rather than learning.

**Warning signs:**
- [ ] You're talking more than they are
- [ ] They are complimenting you or your idea
- [ ] You told them about your idea and don't know what happens next
- [ ] You don't have notes from the conversation
- [ ] You haven't reviewed notes with your team
- [ ] You got an unexpected answer and it didn't change anything you're doing
- [ ] You weren't scared of any question you asked
- [ ] You aren't sure which big question you were trying to answer
- [ ] You aren't sure why you had the meeting at all

If any of these persist across multiple conversations, you are doing something wrong and compounding the cost. Stop. Diagnose. Restart with a clearer goal.

## Speed and Time Investment

The point of the Mom Test process is to move faster, not to add meetings to your calendar.

**Don't spend a week prepping.** Spend an hour. Then go talk to people. Anything more is stalling disguised as diligence.

**Don't spend months doing full-time interviews before building.** Spend one to two weeks getting your bearings, then give customers something concrete to commit to. Commitment is data. Conversations about hypotheticals are not.

**You'll talk to customers for the life of the company** — but it runs alongside building, not in place of it. With Keeping It Casual as a default mode, customer learning doesn't require dedicated time slots. It happens in hallways, at industry events, in five-minute calls.

The rule: Go build your dang company already.

## Asking Important Questions

Every batch of conversations should include at least one question that could completely destroy your currently imagined business.

If you get an unexpected answer and it doesn't change what you're doing, the question wasn't important enough.

**How to find important questions:**

Run the thought experiments from prep: imagine the company failed — why? Imagine a huge success — what had to be true? The answers name the risks. Go test those.

**"You should be terrified of at least one question you're asking in every conversation."**

If all your questions feel safe, you're avoiding the real unknowns. The questions that make your stomach tighten are usually the most valuable.

**Managing your question list over time:**

Prepare your 3 most important questions for each type of person you're meeting. This list changes as you learn — choose the murkiest and most consequential right now. Don't repeat questions you already have reliable answers to. Pick up where you left off.

Having your list ready also means you can take advantage of serendipitous encounters. When you run into a potential customer at a conference, you can pop off your top question immediately instead of fumbling for an excuse to get coffee.

## Loving Bad News

Bad news is the most valuable output of a customer conversation.

If you spend $5,000 worth of time to learn you're on a dead end, that's great — you still have $45,000 left and you know which direction not to go. The worst outcome is spending all $50,000 ignoring bad news while searching for tiny grains of validation.

**Lukewarm responses are highly informative:**

"Meh." "That's pretty neat." "Interesting idea." These are crystal clear signals that the person doesn't care. They are not hedging. They are telling you the truth in the softest way they know how.

The classic mistake: interpret lukewarm as insufficient pitch effort and keep pushing until they say something nice. This produces false positives only. You've taught them that enthusiasm makes you go away.

When you get a lukewarm response, ask a few follow-up questions to understand the nature of the apathy. Then thank them genuinely and leave. That "meh" was a gift.

"There's more reliable information in a 'meh' than a 'Wow!'"

Excitement is easy to fake. Apathy is not.
